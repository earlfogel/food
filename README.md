Bread, biscuits, muffins and other breakfast foods.

## Corn Bread

1 cup white flour<br/>
2 tsp baking powder<br/>
1/2 tsp baking soda<br/>

1 1/2 tsp salt<br/>
1 1/2 tsp yeast (1/2 package)<br/>
1 1/2 cup lukewarm water (maybe a bit more)<br/>

Mix flour, salt, yeast.
Stir in water.
Cover loosely.
Let sit 3 hours, or until doubled in bulk.

Preheat oven, oven-safe pan and lid to 450 F.

Sprinkle dough with flour and loosen from bowl.

## Moosewood Cottage Cheese Herb Bread

1 cup whole wheat flour<br/>
1 1/3 to 2 cup white flour<br/>
1 tbsp yeast<br/>
1 tsp salt<br/>
1 tsp baking powder<br/>
2 tbsp sugar<br/>
1 cup cottage cheese<br/>
1 tbsp vegetable oil<br/>
1/2 tsp minced fresh thyme<br/>
1 tsp minced fresh rosemary<br/>
2 tbsp minced scallions<br/>
1/2 ice cold water<br/>

Mix flour, yeast, salt and baking powder in food processor for 5 seconds.

Mix cottage cheese, oil, sugar, herbs, and scallions, add to food
processor and blend 5-10 seconds.

Gradually add ice water, while blending, until dough is smooth and elastic
(45-60 seconds).  If dough is too wet or too dry, add more flour or water, 2
tbsp at a time.

Shape the dough into a ball, sprinkle with flour and place in a bowl. Cover
with a damp towel and set in a warm spot for about 45 mins, until doubled in
size.

After the dough rises, punch it down, shape it into a ball and place in an
oiled 2-quart casserole dish. Return the dough to its warm place and let it
rise again until doubled, about 30-45 mins.

Preheat the oven to 350 F near the end of the second rising time. When the
dough has doubled in size, bake 25-30 mins until it is golden brown and
sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom. Cool on a rack about 10 mins and
it will be easier to slice.
